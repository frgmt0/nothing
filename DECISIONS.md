# DECISIONS.md

This file records deliberate design commitments and the deviations from them.
Do not relitigate a commitment mid-build; if one turns out wrong, add a dated
entry below with evidence and change it on purpose.

## Design commitments

- **Implementation language:** Rust. Workspace with separate crates so the
  core stays usable as a library.

  Rationale: keeping `core` a plain library with no editor or IO dependency
  is what lets it be embedded in a REPL harness, a TUI, a serialisation
  format, and eventually an agent protocol without any of those pulling
  `core` toward their own assumptions.

- **Editor surface v1:** terminal TUI via `ratatui`. Fast to iterate, forces
  keyboard-first design, no layout rabbit holes. Web/GPU surface comes
  later, in Phase 11, only once the action grammar is settled.

  Rationale: a terminal UI has no mouse and no pixel layout to fuss over, so
  every interaction has to be expressible as a keystroke from day one —
  which is exactly the constraint the action grammar needs to be judged
  honestly, before a GUI's affordances paper over a bad grammar.

- **Incompleteness is first-class.** Every program is well-typed at every
  instant, including mid-edit. There is no "broken" state. Holes are
  values.

  Rationale: if "the program doesn't typecheck right now" is ever a
  reachable state, every downstream consumer (evaluator, serialiser, diff
  engine) has to defend against it forever; ruling it out at the action
  layer means those consumers get to assume well-typedness as an invariant
  instead of a hope.

- **Names are not identity.** Every binder gets a stable ID. The display
  name is metadata. Rename is a metadata write.

  Rationale: identity-by-ID is what makes rename, multi-user name overlays,
  and content-addressed hashing (which must ignore names) all trivial
  instead of each needing its own bespoke string-matching logic.

- **Type discipline:** bidirectional typing (synthesis + analysis). Not
  Hindley–Milner, not fully annotated. Bidirectional gives the editor the
  thing it needs most — a *known expected type at the cursor* — and that
  expected type is what powers completion, agent edits, and error
  recovery.

  Rationale: an editor that always knows the expected type at the cursor
  can rank completions and reject-or-hole-wrap constructions locally,
  without a whole-program inference pass running after every keystroke.

- **No stringly-typed intermediate.** If you find yourself writing
  `format!` to build a program and re-reading it, stop. That is the
  failure mode this project exists to eliminate.

  Rationale: the entire premise of a projectional editor collapses the
  moment a text intermediate becomes load-bearing anywhere in the pipeline,
  because then that text format silently becomes the real source of truth
  and the AST becomes a derived, second-class view of it.

### 2026-08-26 — `nothing-*` crate naming

`cargo` rejects `core` as a package name because it conflicts with Rust's
own built-in `core` crate (the no-std prelude crate every crate implicitly
depends on). The spec's workspace layout calls for a crate directory named
`core`; that directory name is kept exactly as specified, but the package
name inside `core/Cargo.toml` (and each sibling crate) is prefixed:
`nothing-core`, `nothing-action`, `nothing-eval`, `nothing-store`,
`nothing-tui`, `nothing-bench`. Directory names in the workspace
(`core/`, `action/`, `eval/`, `store/`, `tui/`, `bench/`) match the spec
verbatim; only the `[package] name` fields and inter-crate `path`
dependencies use the `nothing-` prefix. `cargo run -p nothing-bench` (not
`-p bench`) is the invocation going forward.
